# Learnings and Tweaks

## Module 1

### Introduction

1. **What I learned?** Got an overview of what agents are and how they work. Learned that the module will cover generic agent architectures, common challenges developers face, and why building custom gents with domain-specific workflows is important for reliability. Understood that LangGraph models agent workflows as graphs and will teach core concepts like state, nodes, edges, tools, messages, looping (React architecture), and memory. Also learned we'll be using LangGraph Studio throughout for building and debugging

2. **Code Tweaks?** None
